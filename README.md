DRIVE DataSet
DRIVE: Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction The DRIVE database has been established to enable comparative studies on segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images. Retinal vessel segmentation and delineation of morphological attributes of retinal blood vessels, such as length, width, tortuosity, branching patterns and angles are utilized for the diagnosis, screening, treatment, and evaluation of various cardiovascular and ophthalmologic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, arteriosclerosis and chorodial neovascularization

The photographs for the DRIVE database were obtained from a diabetic retinopathy screening program in The Netherlands The set of 40 images has been divided into a training and a test set, both containing 20 images.
